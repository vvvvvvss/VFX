# VFX - Level 1

## Installation

To get started with DaVinci Resolve, I downloaded the installer from the official Blackmagic Design website. The installation process was pretty straightforward.  
- Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen prompts.
- Select your preferred installation path and components.
- After installation, launch the application and configure your settings (such as GPU, storage, and default project folders) in the initial setup screen.

## Media Page

The **Media Page** in DaVinci Resolve is the hub for importing, organizing, and previewing all your video, audio, and image assets. Key features include:
- **Media Storage Panel**: Browse your drives and import files directly
- **Bins & Organization**: Create folders (bins) to arrange clips by project, scene, or type
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Quickly move assets to timelines on the Cut or Edit pages

This page streamlines the workflow, ensuring all your materials are accessible and well-organized before you begin editing.

## The Cut Page
The Cut Page is an editing workspace with the purpose of assembling fast-paced videos with efficiency and clarity. Unlike complex and multi-layered timelines in traditional editors, the Cut Page is designed for rapid review, trimming, and smart assembly of short-form storytelling which makes it ideal for social media content, vlogs, and explainer videos.  

#### Key Features:
1. **Dual Timelines:** Access both an overview and detailed timeline for quick navigation and adjustments.    
2. **Source Tape:** Review all clips like a film reel, eliminating the need to search through bins.    
3. **Instant Cut Tools:** Ripple edits, smart trimming, and blade cutting enable fast arranging, reordering and sequencing.   
4. **Transitions &amp; Effects:** Ready-made transitions and simple drag-and-drop effects that are perfect for fast alternations, quick wipes, and attention-grabbing jumps.  
5. **Integrated Audio:** Preview and adjust audio cues and background music in real-time for pacing and emotional impact.  
    
### **Why It’s Great for Social Media Storytelling:**  
1. **Pace:** Supports 1-minute, ultra-fast videos with precision.  
2. **Simplicity:** Reduces timeline clutter for a focus on story beats.   
3. **Versatility:** Mixes live action, screen recordings, graphics, and text overlays easily.

## The Edit Page 

The **Edit Page** is an editing workspace designed for detailed, layered video production. Unlike the fast-paced, assembly-focused Cut Page, the Edit Page excels at complex edits, precise clip placement, transitions, and audio control.

#### Key Features:
- **Layered Timeline**: Allows stacking video, voiceover, music, and effects tracks for detailed control.
- **Advanced Trimming**: Multi-mode trimming tools (Ripple, Roll, Slip) for perfect cut placement and timing adjustments.
- **Transitions &amp; Effects Library**: Drag-and-drop transitions like crossfades, dissolves, wipes for smooth scene changes.
- **Audio Tools**: Built-in mixer for balancing voiceover, environmental sound, and music. 


#### Why Use the Edit Page for “Walking on Earth Gently”:
- **Precision**: Align voiceover precisely with visuals.
- **Creativity**: Layer farm and nature clips for mood and pacing.
- **Control**: Tweak individual clip volumes and transitions for atmosphere.
